# PythonRandomVideoPlayer
I got tired of having to watch tv shows I want to put in the background one at a time. I thought maybe I could make an app that'll randomly play videos you choose like how TV use too except without all the annoying ads!


I ran into an issue with needing a codec to play mp4s with QMediaPlayer. Until I figure out a workaround this link is what I found helpful to play them: https://clay-atlas.com/us/blog/2020/10/14/pyqt5-en-qmediaplayer-directshowplayerservice/
